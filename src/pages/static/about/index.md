title: About

This is a personal website, not a reflection of my professional portfolio.

I started this site mostly out of nostalgia and wanting to support a simpler, open, free internet. As more and more content is aggregated and curated on various networks, I wanted a place to do whatever I felt like doing. <sup>(1)</sup>

So this website exists as a silly place for me to put things I care about, without caring as much about why I'm putting it here, and without thinking about who I'm putting it here for. It's a place for me to play with static site generators, talk about things I'm thinking about, and post photos of what's happening in my life.
