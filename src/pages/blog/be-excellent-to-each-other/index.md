## Be Excellent to Each Other

I'm always surprised by how dense LA is, because I feel like I always have to drive to get to where I want to go. 

With a little bit of effort though, you can usually spend a whole day on a few city blocks.

Starting on Wilshire and Grand, you can go to the Karl Strauss brewing company, and then cross 7th street for sushi at SUGARFISH.

Treat yourself to some desserts at Bottega Louie across brand, head down 8th to Olive Street and stop by the Modern Times Dankness Dojo and sample more hazy IPA's than you can handle. 

One block further South on Olive, you can stop by Mikkeller DTLA to sample some more beers.
